# Email Spam Filtering
This repository includes code for machine learning models that filter spam emails from non-spam (ham) ones. Each model was trained using one of the following algorithms:

- Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- KNNs (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- SVMs (Support Vector Machines)
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost

The code was written entirely in Python version 3.13.2 on Jupyter Notebook. All of these algorithms, excluding XGBoost, were imported from scikit-learn. Other scikit-learn functions used here include LabelEncoder, CountVectorizer, accuracy_score, and classification_report. Pandas was also used in this project. All of the models perform on the same dataset downloaded from kaggle.com.

**Make sure the aforementioned libraries are installed before executing the code.**
