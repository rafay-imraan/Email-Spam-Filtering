# Email Spam Filtering
This repository includes code for machine learning models that filter spam emails from non-spam (ham) ones. Each model was trained using one of the following algorithms:

- Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- KNNs (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- SVMs (Support Vector Machines)
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost

The code was written entirely in [Python](https://python.org) version 3.13.2 on Jupyter Notebook. All of these algorithms, excluding XGBoost, were imported from [scikit-learn](https://www.scikit-learn.org). Other scikit-learn functions used here include LabelEncoder, CountVectorizer, accuracy_score, and classification_report. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) was also used in this project. All of the models perform on the same dataset downloaded from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com).

**MAKE SURE THE AFOREMENTIONED LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED BEFORE EXECUTING THE CODE.**
